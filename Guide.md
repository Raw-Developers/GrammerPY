Python is an open-source programming language. It offers a vast variety of libraries that provide greater functionalities. The one such library is language_check. The language_check library doesn’t come bundled with Python 3. Instead, you have to manually download it from the command line or download it from the pypi.org and then install it manually.
For those using python 3, 
open your command line and type in:-

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install --upgrade language-check


#If you are using Python 2, you’ll need to install 3to2 beforehand:

$ pip install --upgrade 3to2

Requirements
Python v3.3+ (or 2.7)
Java v6.0 or higher.
